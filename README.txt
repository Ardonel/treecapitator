[14.03.2015] Added sound of a falling tree (taken from there http://www.freesound.org/people/ecfike/sounds/139952/). Made "drop_items" and "drop_leaf" both "true" by default. (mintpick)

TODO:
— add more trees
— add more types of trees
— remove nodes at once and play sound if much nodes are removed
